- good ideas for classes to make: (team class, fixture class)
- take input files of a list of teams and use those to make a fixture list
- as an aside to above: make a program that allows a user to make an input file in that format
- assign fixtures based on allowed dates, avoid close teams having home games on the same day, and other rules from the prem article
- prem fixture compiler article:  https://www.premierleague.com/news/261976 
- output a repository that stores 38 files, each file having the 10 fixtures for a respective matchweek, for a total of 380 fixtures
- maybe also use some html stuff to make this a working website? idk
